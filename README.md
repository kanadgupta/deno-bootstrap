# Deno Bootstrap ðŸ¦•

Got inspired by [this blog post](https://deno.com/blog/node-config-hell) and
created a super tiny template repository (the only thing of value in this repo
is a VSCode configuration file) so I can quickly start building projects with
Deno.

You can run the file in this repository with the following:

```sh
deno run --allow-env index.ts
```

## Versions (as of this writing)

`deno --version` output:

```
deno 1.36.0 (release, aarch64-apple-darwin)
v8 11.6.189.12
typescript 5.1.6
```

VSCode extension version:
[`v3.20.0`](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno/tree/3.20.0)
